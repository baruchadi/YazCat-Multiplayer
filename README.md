# YazCat-Multiplayer
Multiplayer snake game, inspired by a friend's love to cats and pizza. 

TODO: 
fix up the way the server sends data back. The character does not show up properly. 
add more features like power ups?

just a project for fun, using P5.js for graphics, Node.js, Express js, & socketIO for server side.
